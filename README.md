# Cyber sources for Cygwin/Qt 5.9

## Why Cygwin? Wouldn't WSL be better?
Yes, WSL is better.

Though, WSL is cheating. It won't provide us with native binaries for Windows.

I also don't feel like paying for a "Pro" version of Windows 10 1909+ just to get access to the virtualization framework for WSL 2, which sometimes breaks compatibility with other hypervisors such as VMware.

## Why such an old version?
Cygwin, that's why. They haven't updated their fucking Qt5 builds to 5.15, making any good Cyber builds **impossible** to create without manually compiling Qt 5.15.

## Note
This source code barely fucking works. While I did manage to get some workable builds out of this, I do not expect you to have the same amount of luck.

Don't ask me for help building this. It was a nightmare for me as well. **Suffer with me.**
